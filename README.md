An **unfinished** zombie survival MMO using Corona and Lua. Play as either a zombie or a human in a fight for survival.  The game is set to replicate a [prey-predator model](http://www.tiem.utk.edu/~gross/bioed/bealsmodules/pred-prey.gph1.gif) of population. 

Human Survivor
==============

*Featuring:*
+ **+40 Different Items**
+ **+40 Skills**

*Multiple Classes:*
+ **Military** - Improved combat abilities 
+ **Research** - Improved healing and gadget capabilities
+ **Engineering** - Improved construction and equipment efficiency  

Play as a human with a simple goal - *survive*. Using many items, gadgets, weapons, and equipment at your disposal you can fend off the undead hordes. Barricade and repair buildings. Search for supplies. Coordinate with the other survivors to stay alive. Humans have the advantage of technology and the ability to interact with their environment to prolong their lifespan, their only true weakness... death.

Undead Zombie
=============

*Featuring:*  
+ **+10 Abilities**
+ **+40 Skills**

*Multiple Classes:*
+ **Brute** - Boosted attacks and lethality
+ **Hunter** - Upgraded movement and tracking utility
+ **Hive** - Dangerous item or building corrosion and infection spread

As a zombie you have one raw need - *food*. And what better food than the fleshy human meatbags that are hiding away in fear? To satiate your hunger, you must work together with your fellow zombie brethren. Use abilities, sheer numbers, and persistence to tear down barricades and reap the soon to be corpses (humans) inside buildings. Zombies do **NOT** fear death. It only slows them down. The only true fear that a zombie has is... starvation.

Time Based Leveling
===================

There is no gathering XP by kills, training, or healing in this game. The only measure is time. The longer your character survives the more abilities and skills they unlock to help with your goals. If you survive long enough, a player can even select a class to unlock for even better skills and perks. Beware though, that the skill system is based on a [parabola](http://www.phas.ubc.ca/~mav/SOP2015/fig3.jpeg). The more skills you have already, the longer it will take to unlock the next one, so pick wisely!

`1.0.0` Release Date
==================

Development is dependent on my free time and level of boredom.  ETA until App Store launch is in 2018.  I will update this timeline with more specific season/month/week dates as I get closer and closer to the finish line.
