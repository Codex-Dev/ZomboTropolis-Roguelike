-- ZOMBIE REVIVE WITH ANKLE GRAB --

Min Revive - 4 AP = 20 HP 

zombies spawn with minimum hp and every ap gives additional hp.  
1 ap =  5 hp  (20 HP = [4-10] = 50 HP)
1 ap = 10 hp  (20 HP = [2- 5] = 50 HP)

Feed on a corpse results in 15hp gain?  Rejuv boosts that to +30?
Bite attacks grant full damage to hp.  Or maybe half.
