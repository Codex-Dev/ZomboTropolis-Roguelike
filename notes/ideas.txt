Give humans item to disguise themselves as zombies to avoid detection

Upgrade doors with item?  Give them hp?

Equip a building with barbed wire that damages zombies?

Only roof travel from powered buildings?  Does this apply to the building jumping to or from?  Or both?

Military class humans function as a blocker when hunter zombies try to leap into the occupied building.  (similiar to how the brute zombies block humans from barricading)

Make item repairs work by players giving person item, and the person repairing the item in their inventory.
